GOOGLE ADS POWER PACK — HOTEL SOP (v1.0, Apr 2026)

This system of three AI-driven campaigns covers the full booking funnel:
- Demand Gen — TOF, YouTube / Discover / Gmail. Warms the audience pool.
- Search + AI Max — MOF/BOF. Captures intent.
- Performance Max — Full funnel. Convert and scale.

All three must run together. Running individually leaves traffic on the table.

    # ── Part 1 — Demand Gen ───────────────────────────────
    "PART_1.CREATIVE":
        "Demand Gen asset hierarchy: Video (YouTube Shorts 9:16 or in-stream 16:9) is the strongest asset. "
        "Video + Image in the same asset group delivers +20% conversion vs. video alone. "
        "Never leave a campaign without a real video — Google will auto-generate a low-quality one.",
    "PART_1.BIDDING":
        "Phase 1 (weeks 1–2 while audience is cold): use tCPM to optimize reach. "
        "Phase 2 (after ≥2 weeks with enough click data): switch to Maximize Conversions.",
    "PART_1.ATTRIBUTION":
        "Attribution model must be Data-Driven, not Last Click. Last Click undervalues Demand Gen touchpoints.",
    "PART_1.FREQUENCY":
        "Remarketing frequency benchmark: 3–7 per week (action required above 10). "
        "Cold-audience frequency benchmark: 1–3 per week (action required above 5).",
    "PART_1.AUDIENCE":
        "Audience priority for Demand Gen: (1) Customer Match past guests, (2) booking-page remarketing, "
        "(3) all-site remarketing, (4) lookalikes, (5) custom intent competitors, (6) custom intent destination, "
        "(7) Optimized Targeting (cold campaigns only). "
        "NEVER enable Optimized Targeting on Remarketing — it dilutes the high-value pool.",
    "PART_1.KPI":
        "VTR >30% for in-stream (alert below 20%); image/carousel CTR >0.5% (alert below 0.2%); "
        "view-through conversions should trend up week-over-week.",

    # ── Part 2 — Search + AI Max ──────────────────────────
    "PART_2.RULE_1":
        "Rule #1: Branded and non-branded MUST run in separate campaigns. Bidding strategy, ROAS target, "
        "and negative list management differ. Mixing makes ROI measurement impossible and PMax will steal "
        "branded traffic.",
    "PART_2.BRANDED":
        "Branded Search: Target Impression Share ≥90% top-of-page. Exact + Phrase only (no broad). "
        "24/7 schedule, unlimited budget cap. Add branded keywords as negatives on non-branded and on PMax.",
    "PART_2.BRAND_EXCLUSION":
        "PMax must have a Brand Exclusion list covering the hotel name and variants — otherwise PMax will "
        "cannibalize branded traffic and report inflated ROAS.",
    "PART_2.AIMAX":
        "AI Max safe setup: (1) PIN brand name to Headline 1, (2) turn OFF Final URL Expansion for the first "
        "2 weeks, (3) enable Search Term Matching first, review weekly and add negatives, (4) only enable "
        "Text Customization after 2 weeks of clean search terms. Never enable AI Max on branded campaigns.",
    "PART_2.RSA":
        "RSA: Ad Strength target Good, aim for Excellent. Minimum 8–10 distinct headlines and 3–4 descriptions. "
        "Pin at most 2–3 positions — leave room for AI to test.",
    "PART_2.NEGATIVES":
        "Shared negative list covers: jobs/career, press/media, academic research, free/gratis, "
        "cancel/refund/complaint, competitor brand terms (unless running competitor campaign). "
        "Review weekly in the first month, every 2 weeks thereafter.",

    # ── Part 3 — Performance Max ──────────────────────────

    "PART_3.BIDDING":
        "Lifecycle: Week 1-2 Max Conversions (no tCPA). Week 3-6 Max Conversions + tCPA 20-30% above actual. "
        "Month 2-3 tCPA at actual. Month 4+ tROAS (once revenue value data is clean). "
        "Never change bid strategy or tCPA more than 20% in one step — resets learning phase for 1–2 weeks.",
    "PART_3.BRAND_SAFETY":
        "Brand leak pattern: PMax ROAS abnormally high AND branded Search impressions drop week-over-week. "
        "PMax is stealing branded traffic — add the brand exclusion list at account level immediately.",

    # ── Part 4 — Conversion Tracking ──────────────────────
    "PART_4.PRIMARY":
        "Only Booking Confirmed is Primary (account-level). Checkout Initiated / Room Selection / "

    "PART_4.ENHANCED":
        "Enhanced Conversions for web captures 10–30% additional conversions via hashed first-party data. "
        "Always enable.",
    "PART_4.RECONCILIATION":

    # ── Part 5 — 1st-party Data ───────────────────────────
    "PART_5.CUSTOMER_MATCH":
        "Refresh Customer Match monthly from PMS. Segments: VIP (>X spend or ≥3 stays, bid +30-50%), "

    # ── Part 6 — Budget & Seasonality ─────────────────────

    "PART_6.BUDGET_PACING":
        "If PMax daily spend exhausts before 2 pm local on 3 of the last 7 days, budget is too low for the "
