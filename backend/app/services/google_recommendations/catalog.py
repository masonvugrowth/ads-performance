"""Recommendation type catalog.

Single source of truth for every rec_type produced by detectors. Drives:
- detector self-registration (catalog spec populates class attributes)
- frontend label map (rec_type → title template)
- applier dispatch (auto_applicable gate)
- migration / seeding sanity checks

Keep this file aligned with the SOP (Google_Ads_Power_Pack_Hotel_SOP.docx)
and the plan at ~/.claude/plans/ (Section 10, Rec Type Catalog).
